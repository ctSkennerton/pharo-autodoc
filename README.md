# Pharo Autodoc
This is a very rough exploration on how to make autogenerated documentation in other markdown formats like Sphinx.

Made possible through the excellent reflective abilities of Pharo.


```smalltalk
ad := AutoDoc new.
rws := String new writeStream.
ad outputStream: rws.
ad toSphinx: Dictionary
```
